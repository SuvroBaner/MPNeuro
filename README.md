nlxio directory includes modules for reading from following filetypes: (adapted from bwillers/nlxio)
*  .ncs continous sample files
*  .ntt tetrode spike files
*  .nev event files
*  .plx files

A description of the Neuralynx file formats is available on [their website](http://neuralynx.com/research_software/development_software/).

More directories to come as I figure stuff out
